    "- `import random as rn`. This is just like doing `import random`, but where you would write e.g. `random.randrange`, you write `rn.randrange`. You can replace `rn` with anything, so long as you are consistent. So you could write `import random as flying_elephant` if you're happy to keep writing `flying_elephant.randrange` every time you want to use the function. It's mostly used to make things shorter, and there are some common short names that people use - if you stick to those, it'll be easier to share code. Examples `import pandas as pd`, `import seaborn as sns`.\n",
    "- `from random import choice`. This is a bit different. Now, instead of writing `random.choice([True,False])` in your code, you can just write `choice([True,False])`. This makes your code shorter, but it's harder for someone else to figure out what `choice` means, or what library it belongs to. You can import lots of things this way, e.g. `from random import choice, randrange`."
